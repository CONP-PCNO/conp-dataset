Microstructure-Informed Connectomics (MICs) dataset.

Description: The MICs dataset provides raw and fully processed multimodal neuroimaging data acquired in 50 healthy control participants at 3T. Modalities include high-resolution anatomical (T1w), microstructurally-sensitive (T1 mapping), diffusion-weighted and resting-state functional imaging. In addition, MICs provides ready-to-use connectomes built across multiple parcellation schemes and spatial scales based on each of these modalities.
