# The Cuban Human Brain Mapping Normative database

The Cuban Human Brain Mapping Project (CHBMP) repository is
an open multimodal neuroimaging and cognitive dataset from 282 healthy participants (31.9
± 9.3 years, age range 18–68 years). 

This dataset was acquired from 2004 to 2008 as a subset
of a larger stratified random sample of 2,019 participants from La Lisa municipality in La
Habana, Cuba. The exclusion included presence of disease or brain dysfunctions. 

The information made available for all participants comprises: high-density (64-120 channels)
resting state electroencephalograms (EEG), magnetic resonance images (MRI), psychological
tests (MMSE, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -WAIS III, computerized reaction time tests
using a go no-go paradigm), as well as general information (age, gender, education, ethnicity,
handedness and weight). 
  - The EEG data contains recordings with at least 30 minutes duration including the following 
  conditions: eyes closed, eyes open, hyperventilation and subsequent recovery. 
  - The MRI consisted in anatomical T1 as well as diffusion weighted (DWI)
images acquired on a 1.5 Tesla system. 

The data is available for registered users on the LORIS
database which is part of the MNI neuroinformatics ecosystem (https://chbmp-open.loris.ca).
