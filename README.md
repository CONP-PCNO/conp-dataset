# CONP dataset

CONP dataset is a repository containing the datasets available in the 
Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform. It leverages 
[DataLad](http://datalad.org) to store metadata and references to 
data files distributed in various storage spaces and accessible depending on each data owner's 
policy.

## Dataset structure

The dataset is structured as follows:

* `investigators` contains sub-datasets for investigators based in Canada.
* `projects` contains sub-datasets for projects hosted in Canada.

Investigators and projects are responsible for the management and curation 
of their own sub-datasets.

## Accessing data

Requirements:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Git annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com/install)
* DataLad: `pip install git+https://github.com/datalad/datalad.git`

To start, install the main CONP dataset on your computer:

```console
datalad install -r http://github.com/CONP-PCNO/conp-dataset
```

Get the files you are interested in:

```console
datalad get <file_name>
```

This may require authentication depending on the data owner's configuration.

You can also search for relevant files and sub-datasets as follows:

```console
datalad search T1
```


## Adding data

If you are an investigator or a project manager, you can create a 
sub-dataset in the CONP repository as follows:

1. Fork the CONP data repository on GitHub:
   * Navigate to http://github.com/CONP-PCNO/conp-dataset (this page)
   * In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork. 
   * This will create a copy of the dataset at http://github.com:username/conp-dataset

2. Install your fork on your computer:

```console
datalad install git@github.com:<username>/conp-dataset
```

3. Create your sub-dataset in your cloned fork, under `investigators` or `projects`. For instance:

```console
datalad create -d . investigators/<username>
```

4. Publish your sub-dataset:

    From the main repository (`conp-dataset`):

    a. Add a sibling for your dataset on GitHub:

    ```console
    datalad create-sibling-github -d investigators/<username> conp-dataset-<username>
    ```

    DataLad will ask your GitHub user name and password to create the sibling.

    b. Update the `.gitmodules` file to add your sibling. It should contain a section that looks like this:

    ```
    [submodule "investigators/<username>"]
        path = investigators/<username>
        url = http://github.com:<username>/conp-dataset-<username>.git
    ```

    Note the Git endpoint in the url.

5. Add files to your sub-dataset:

    From your sub-dataset (`investigators/<username>`):
    
    a. Create and add a README.md file, directly in the Git repository:
    ```console
    datalad add --to-git ./README.md
    ```

    b. Add a file accessible through http (for instance an image file):
    ```console
    git annex addurl <url> --file <local_path>
    ```

    c. Publish the modifications:
    ```console
    datalad save
    datalad publish --to github
    ```
    
7. Publish the modifications to your fork of the main dataset:

    From the main repository (`conp-dataset`):
    ```console
    datalad save
    datalad publish --to origin
    ```

8. Publish modifications to the main dataset:

    Create a new pull request from http://github.com:username/conp-dataset to http://github.com/CONP-PCNO/conp-dataset.

    TODO: add a screenshot here.

Once the pull request is accepted by the CONP data managers, your 
dataset is created in the CONP repository. It is then up to you to manage its content and 
decide on the creation of sub-datasets in it. Modifications to 
your dataset can be propagated to the CONP dataset through pull 
requests, by repeating the last step above.

We welcome your feedback! :smiley:
